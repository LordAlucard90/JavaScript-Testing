# JavaScript-Testing

In this repository I'll made the steps of the
"[JavaScript Unit Testing - The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-unit-testing-the-practical-guide)" course.

The repository is divided by the main topics, 
each one is divided by the different course steps/lessons (step is not equal to video).
Each step contains a readme with the explanation of the step and, 
if is change from the previous step, the new code.
